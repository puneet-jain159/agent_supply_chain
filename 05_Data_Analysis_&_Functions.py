# MAGIC This notebook performs:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Raw Material Analysis: Identifies critical materials with supply shortages by comparing demand vs supply data
# MAGIC - BOM Relationship Mapping: Analyzes the hierarchical relationships between raw materials, intermediate materials and final products
# MAGIC - Custom Functions:
# MAGIC   - product_from_raw: Maps a raw material to all downstream products
# MAGIC   - raw_from_product: Maps a product to all upstream raw materials
# MAGIC   - revenue_risk: Calculates potential revenue impact from raw material shortages

# MAGIC The goal is to identify the most critical raw material with potential shortages.
